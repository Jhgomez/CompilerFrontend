# Description
This repo contains class and laboratory examples to learn compilers concepts. We started with the dragon book compiler frontend [here](./DragonBookCompFrontend). The second directory created 
was [PeggyJsPractice](./PeggyJsPractice) which contains the examples we saw in laboratory, however they are not a copy, I replicated them "manually", they are the examples used as a reference
to be able to build the first project which is an interpreter. Compilers concepts was recorded in [this](./clasesParcial2), the images in the home directoy were useful in building the first
project, they helped understanding how to declare the grammar using PeggyJs. The [assembly](./assembly) directory contains 32bits risc-v examples from the class and the laboratory along with
some documentation to understand the syntax of this assembly language. The projects are contain in [this](./ProjectoParser) directory, a description of each project can be found there
